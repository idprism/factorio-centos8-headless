Factorio Headless
=========

Uses some projects created by others to very simplistically deploy a headless (linux x86_64/amd64) factorio server.

Requirements
------------

Glibc >= 2.18

Role Variables
--------------

Don't use parameters for this role, just set them up in the file.

Dependencies
------------

N/A

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - factorio_headless
